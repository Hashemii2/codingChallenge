Task

You are given n rectangular boxes, the ith box has the length lengthi,
the width widthi and the height heighti.

Your task is to check if it is possible to pack all boxes into one so
that inside each box there is no more than one another box (which, in
turn, can contain at most one another box, and so on).

More formally, your task is to check whether there is such sequence of
n different numbers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) that for each 1 ≤ i < n the box
number pi can be put into the box number pi+1.

A box can be put into another box if all sides of the first one are
less than the respective ones of the second one. You can rotate each
box as you wish, i.e. you can swap its length, width and height if
necessary.

Example

For length = [1, 3, 2], width = [1, 3, 2] and height = [1, 3, 2], the output should be true;

For length = [1, 1], width = [1, 1] and height = [1, 1], the output should be false;

For length = [3, 1, 2], width = [3, 1, 2] and height = [3, 2, 1], the output should be false.

Input/Output

[input] integer array length

Array of positive integers.

Constraints:

1 ≤ length.length ≤ 100,

1 ≤ length[i] ≤ 2000.

[input] integer array width

Array of positive integers.

Constraints:

width.length = length.length,

1 ≤ width[i] ≤ 2000.

[input] integer array height

Array of positive integers.

Constraints:

height.length = length.length,

1 ≤ height[i] ≤ 2000.

[output] a boolean value

true if it is possible to put all boxes into one, false otherwise.
