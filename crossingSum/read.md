- Task

Given a rectangular matrix and integers a and b, consider the
union of the ath row and the bth (both 0-based) column of the matrix.
Return sum of all elements of that union.

Example

For:

matrix = [[1, 1, 1, 1],            [2, 2, 2, 2],            [3, 3, 3, 3]]
a = 1 and b = 3 the output should be 12.

Here (2 + 2 + 2 + 2) + (1 + 3) = 12.
